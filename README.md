The following codes were used to generate the data and figures presented in "Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Defective Interfering
Particles in Reducing the Replication of SARS-CoV-2" by Locke, Grebennikov et al.

The codes are for the following steps:

.Parameter refinement
.Sensitivity Analysis
.Deterministic model outputs
.Stochastic model outputs

All the codes within have been generated by M. Locke and D. Grebennikov and will see minimal support or changes made after submission.
